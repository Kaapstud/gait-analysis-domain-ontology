 The Gait Analysis Domain Ontology (GADO) is a significant advancement in both gait analysis and ontology development.
 Ultimately, it functions as a dynamic knowledge base equipped with intelligent reasoning and semantic capabilities.
 This empowers healthcare professionals and domain experts with superb decision-making support when treating gait-related disorders. GADO's development method ensures flexibility and ongoing updates, incorporating new knowledge as it emerges.
 Through its ability to perform intelligent inferences and provide robust decision support, the GADO ultimately contributes to improved patient care and a deeper understanding of gait-related conditions.
